EXIT THE BINARY MAZE

The program creates a blank 4x10 matrix with an entrance and an exit at [0] and [39], respectively. At each turn, one bit in the matrix is changed from 1 to 0. The program employs dynamic programming and Dijkstra's algorithm to find the route and stop changing the matrix as soon as such a path is created.
